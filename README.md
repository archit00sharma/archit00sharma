- Monolithic architecture

## Architecture
I have experience working with both monolithic and microservice architectures. I understand the benefits and trade-offs of each approach and can design and develop applications accordingly. I also have experience with event-driven communication using Apache Kafka.

## Current Focus
I'm currently focused on enhancing my skills in microservice architecture and event-driven systems using Kafka. Additionally, I'm exploring the capabilities of Fastify, a high-performance web framework, to build efficient and scalable APIs.

## Collaboration
I'm always open to collaborating on Node.js, React, Kafka, or Fastify-related projects. If you have any interesting ideas or projects in mind, feel free to reach out! ü§ù
